Project: Student Grade Tracker

Overview:

The program is designed to track and manage student grades. It provides a simple way for students or teachers to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and displays additional information, such as the overall grade, letter grade, and GPA .
Here are the key components of the program:
________________________________________
1. User Input for Grades:
•	Subject/Assignment Input: The program will allow users to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
•	Flexible Input: Users can input the grades as raw numerical values (e.g., percentages or raw scores), and the program will process these inputs.
2. Calculating Average Grade:
•	The program will compute the average grade from the grades entered for each subject or assignment.
•	This can be done by summing up all the grades and dividing by the total number of grades entered.
3. Displaying Overall Grade:
•	After calculating the average, the program will display the overall grade. The overall grade could be in numeric form (such as percentage or points).
4. Letter Grade and GPA Calculation:
•	Letter Grade Mapping: The program can provide a corresponding letter grade based on the average grade. For example:
o	90% - 100%: O
o	80% - 89%: A
o	70% - 79%: B
o	60% - 69%: C
o	Below 60%: F
•	GPA Calculation (Optional): If needed, the program can also calculate a GPA based on a predefined scale (e.g., A = 4.0, B = 3.0, etc.).
o	The GPA is calculated based on the average grade and mapped to a GPA scale.
o	If a more granular GPA scale (such as decimal values) is used, the program can reflect this as well.
5. Data Validation and Error Handling:
•	Input Validation: The program should ensure that the grades entered are valid numerical values within a reasonable range (typically 0 to 100).
•	Error Handling: If the user inputs incorrect or out-of-range values, the program should prompt the user to correct them.
6. Interactive User Interface:
•	Command-Line Interface (CLI): The program could be designed as a text-based application where users input data and receive output via the console.
•	The interface will guide users step-by-step through the process of entering grades and calculating results.
7. Extensibility and Flexibility:
•	The program could be extended to support additional features, such as:
o	Handling multiple students (by allowing users to input and track grades for different students).
o	Storing grades to a file or database.
o	Handling weighted assignments (e.g., final exam is worth 40% of the total grade, etc.).
________________________________________
Sample Program Flow:
1.	Welcome Message:
o	The user is greeted and prompted to either track grades for a single student or multiple students.
2.	Entering Grades:
o	The user inputs the grades for various subjects or assignments.
o	The program confirms the grades and asks if the user would like to add more grades or proceed.
3.	Calculating Results:
o	The program calculates the average grade from the entered grades.
o	Based on the average, it determines the letter grade and/or GPA.
4.	Displaying the Results:
o	The program displays the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.
o	It could also provide feedback like "Excellent work!" for high grades, or "Needs Improvement" for lower grades.
5.	Repeat Process or Exit:
o	The user can choose to input grades for a different student or subject or exit the program.
